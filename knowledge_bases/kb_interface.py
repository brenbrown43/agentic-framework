Knowledge Base Interface - RAG System Core Component

PRODUCTION RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) SYSTEM  
======================================================

This module provides the core RAG functionality enabling real AI agent intelligence
by connecting agents to structured knowledge bases across all departments.

✅ RAG BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED:
   - Real document access replacing mock responses
   - 66+ knowledge categories across 5 departments
   - Direct file-system document retrieval
   - Character-level content verification

✅ DEPARTMENT COVERAGE:
   - Sales: 13 categories (Customer personas, processes, templates)
   - Marketing: 13 categories (Brand guidelines, audience personas)  
   - Product: 14 categories (Architecture, coding standards, roadmaps)
   - Customer: 12 categories (Success metrics, support playbooks)
   - Back Office: 14 categories (Financial procedures, payroll guides)

✅ FEATURES:
   - Automatic mock/real mode selection
   - Comprehensive document search and retrieval
   - Fallback mechanisms for reliability
   - Performance logging and monitoring

Status: PRODUCTION-READY - Successfully validated end-to-end
Last Updated: 2025-06-13 (Post-RAG-breakthrough)

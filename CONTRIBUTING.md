## Creating New Agents

When creating new example agents:

1. Follow the pattern in `agents/examples/`
2. Include comprehensive docstrings
3. Add tests in `tests/agents/`
4. Update documentation

Example:
```python
class MyAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Clear description of what the agent does"""
    
    def __init__(self, config=None):
        # Agent initialization
        pass
    
    def perform_task(self, input_data):
        """
        Clear description of the task
        
        Args:
            input_data: Description of input
            
        Returns:
            Description of output
        """
        pass
```

## Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use meaningful test names
- Include both unit and integration tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=.

# Run specific test file
